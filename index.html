    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>
      This is an experimental tool in a pre-release state. Post-processing gcode
      is complicated, and bugs could cause your printer to try to move your
      nozzle out of bounds (including crashing into the print bed). The code
      attempts to protect against these cases, but there is no substitute for
      examining the output gcode in a gcode previewer before printing. <strong>Use
        at your own risk.</strong>
    <h2> Purpose </h2>
    <p> There has been some experimentation recently with hiding seems with 3D
      printing. <a href="https://github.com/vgdh/seam-hiding-whitepaper" target="_blank">This repo</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/11621" target="_blank">this PrusaSlicer pull request</a>
      discuss the
      technique, and provide examples using custom generated gcode. However, these
      examples only allow creating a cylinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tool will allow you to load an arbitrary (see requirements below)
      gcode file and apply the technique to it.

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Your gcode file must meet the following requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Marlin gcode</li>
      <li>Absolute positioning for the XYZ coordinates (this is very typical)</li>
      <li>Relative positioning for extruder (also typical)</li>
      <li>No arc moves during actual printing. (You may need to turn off "arc
        fitting" or similar in your slicer)</li>
      <li>Fixed layer height (which should match the layer height you set in the
        form above)</li>
      <li>No "seam gap" in the original gcode. This setting is often set by
        default to avoid extra material building up at the seams, but it
        interferes with loop detection. You should set it to zero in your slicer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In some cases, the tool will detect these issues and alert you. In other
      cases, code where the requirements are not met will simply be skipped
      over. <strong>Always use a slicer or similar tool with a gcode preview to
        verify the output file.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Parameters</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Layer Height</strong> - The layer height of your print. This should
      match the layer height used in your slicer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Overlap Distance</strong> - The distance to overlap the ends of
      each loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Seam Gap</strong> - A fudge factor for preventing zits around the
      seams. This will end the taper early so that an excess of material doesn't
      build up. The correct value will depend on your printer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Extrusion Factor</strong> - Another fudge factor to reduce
      effective overextrusion or underextrusion. This will scale the extrusion amount in the
      overlap region.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Loop Tolerance</strong> - The maximum distance between the start
      and end of a loop. If you can't turn off the "seam gap" setting in your
      slicer, you can compensate it by increasing this value. Note that this may
      cause artifacts in some cases by incorrectly identifying small,
      intentional gaps as loop ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Taper Resolution</strong> - The size of the steps in the taper
      sections which ramp up extrusion and Z height. The smaller this is, the
      larger your output gcode will be. Theoretically, you could set this so low
      that your printer would struggle to read the gcode fast enough during
      printing. Larger values may cause noticeable stair-stepping. You probably
      don't need to change this setting.
